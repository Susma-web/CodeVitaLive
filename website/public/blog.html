        <p>Welcome to Happy Hooligans, where we’re all about easy and affordable crafts and activities for kids!</p>
        <p>I’m Lauren, and the Hooligans are the awesomely silly, creative, fun-loving bunch of little people in my home day-care. We like to keep things simple here. I’m a big fan of play-based learning! Free, unstructured play fosters creativity, imagination and self-confidence. We spend our days in the yard, hanging out by the pond, make-believing in the playhouse, and exploring in the neighbourhood and the nearby ravine. When winter forces us inside, we craft and bake and sing and story-tell our days away, and there are plenty of creative, indoor activities to keep us busy. I’ve been blessed to find so many inspiring bloggers out there like Teacher Tom and Deborah from Teach Preschool who dedicate their lives to their little people, making the time to share their ideas, experiences and philosophies with their followers. That’s why I’m starting this blog.
        I’m new to the whole blog-thing, but I’ll figure it all out because I want to pay it back in some small way, and hopefully inspire others out there who also embrace the philosophy that children learn best through play. Thanks for dropping by!
        Please be patient while I get my site up and running, and please feel free to drop me a line here in the comments or at lauren@happyhooligans.ca
        You can also follow Happy Hooligans on Facebook.
        Yours in Play,
        Lauren & The Hooligans!</p>
